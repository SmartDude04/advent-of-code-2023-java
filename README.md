# 2023 Advent of Code Repository in Java

Certain 2023 Advent of Code Challenges, coded in Java.
The code in this repository is the work of SmartDude04 for the [2023 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023) coding challenges.

## Structure

Inside the package, each day gets its own folder and Java source files.

## Use

This repo is only intended to be viewed to see how I completed each puzzle. **Do not attempt to copy this code to complete the challenges**. That defeats the purpose of the puzzles.
